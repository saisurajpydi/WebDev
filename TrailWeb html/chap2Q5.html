        History
        On 28 May 2015, CEO Brendan Eich (creator of JavaScript and former CEO of Mozilla Corporation) and CTO Brian Bondy founded Brave Software.[7] On 20 January 2016 Brave Software launched the first version of Brave with an ad-blocking feature, and announced plans for a privacy-respecting ad-feature and a revenue-sharing program.[8]
        
        In June 2018, Brave released a pay-to-surf test-version of the browser. This version of Brave came preloaded with approximately 250 ads, and sent a detailed log of the user's browsing activity to Brave for the short-term purpose of testing this functionality. Brave announced that expanded trials would follow.[9] Later that month Brave added support for Tor in its desktop browser's private-browsing mode.[10]</pre>
